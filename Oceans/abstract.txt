abstractPlankton are the foundation of marine ecosystem marine food chain. Plankton are of great value in environmental protection and fishing industries, as a result, the research on plankton plays an essential role in ecosystem balance and economic development. Plankton classification is an important part of plankton research. However, the huge amount and tiny volume of plankton make plankton classification extremely difficult. In this paper, the database we use is a large scale database named WHOI-Plankton, it contains over 3 million images, labeled into 103 classes. Traditional method of plankton classification on this database is time consuming and the effect is poor. In contrast, deep neural network can get great result. The approach of plankton classification we presented is based on convolutional neural network model. In order to get higher classification accuracy, we try to smooth images and remove noises by lowpass filtering and abstract images details and edges by highpass filtering. Gaussian filtering can get good filter effect and reduce ringing effect, so we chose Gaussian lowpass filtering (D0 = 60) and Gaussian highpass filtering (D0 = 60).
