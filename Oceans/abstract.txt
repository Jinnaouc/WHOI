abstract
Plankton are the fundation of marine ecosystem  marine food chain.Planton are of great value in environmental protection and fishing industries, as a result, the research on plankton plays an essential role in ecosystem balance and economic development. Planton classification is an important part of planton research. However, the huge amount and tiny volume of plankton make plankton classification extremely difficult. Tranditional method of plankton classification is time consuming and the effect of classification is poor. In this paper, the database we use in this paper is a large scale database named WHOI-Plankton, it contains over 3 million images, labeled into 103 classes. The approach of plankton classification we presented is based on convolutional neural network model. In order to increase classification accuracy, we processd images by Gaussian low pass filter to smooth images and process images by Gaussian high pass filter to abstract details.
